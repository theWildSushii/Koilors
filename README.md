## How to install and run
Clone or download this repo and use any simple HTTP server you like in the parent folder or open the `index.html` directly in your browser, there's no need for any building as this is written in good ol' plain HTML/JavaScript.

> [!NOTE]
> Don't run your HTTP server on the repo folder itself, run it in its parent folder, this is because a workaround in the web manifest and service worker regarding how GitHub Pages work.

> [!NOTE]
> Opening the `index.html` file directly doesn't allow web browsers to use web workers, instead, a slower fallback will be used.

### Examples
#### Using Node.js
Install `http-server`
```
npm install --global http-server
```
Then
```
cd [path-to-repos-parent-folder]
http-server
```
Or run without installing anything
```
npx http-server [path-to-repos-parent-folder]
```
#### Using Python 2
```
cd [path-to-repos-parent-folder]
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
#### Using Python 3
```
cd [path-to-repos-parent-folder]
python -m http.server
```
